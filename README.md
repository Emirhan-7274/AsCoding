AsCode is a simple encryption and decryption tool that utilizes ASCII codes to transform text into binary and vice versa. This README provides an overview of how to use AsCode to encrypt and decrypt your text using a key.
Encryption

To encrypt your text, follow these steps:

    Install the "En-coder" app.
    Provide the text you want to encrypt as the input. For example, let's use the text "Hello, World!".
    Convert the text into ASCII codes. The ASCII codes for "Hello, World!" are: 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33.
    Enter the key you want to use for encryption. For instance, let's use the key "13".
    Apply the key to each ASCII code. In this case, the encrypted ASCII codes will be: 85, 115, 121, 121, 124, 57, 45, 100, 124, 127, 121, 113, 46.
    Convert the encrypted ASCII codes into binary. The resulting binary codes will be: 01010101 01110011 01111001 01111001 01111100 00111001 00101101 01100100 01111100 01111111 01111001 01110001 00101110.

Decryption

To decrypt the encrypted text, follow these steps:

    Install the "De-coder" app.
    Provide the encrypted text you want to decrypt, along with the key used for encryption. For example, using the encrypted text "Usyy|9-d|ï¿½yq." and the key "13".
    Apply the key to each binary code and convert them back to ASCII codes. In this case, the decrypted ASCII codes will be: 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33.
    Convert the ASCII codes back into their respective characters. The decrypted text will be: "Hello, World!".

Please note that if someone attempts to directly convert the binary codes without the key, they will not obtain the original text.
